Instructions to compile and run file:
To compile, simply type the 'make' command. From there, type 'mysh' to run the program. Next, enter any number of
commands. When you are finished, hit CTRL + C to get a list of the last 10 commands entered. From this list, you 
can type r <letter> to enter a command starting with <letter> (if none are found, just runs the most recent command).
Additionally, you can type r to run the most recent command.

IMPORTANT NOTE: everything from lab 3 is fully functioning (fixed from last time). I could not figure out how to get this to write/read properly. As such because of the added stuff, the file terminates
execution for some reason after entering one command. To prove it's working, you comment out lines 103 - 107 and line 355 and remake.

USED ONE SOURCE AS AN *EXAMPLE* - I did not COPY any code - simply used a resource to guide me. Source listed below:
